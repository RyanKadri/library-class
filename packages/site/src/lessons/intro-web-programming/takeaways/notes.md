## Class 2

- Rather than teaching styles first and CSS second, what if I taught CSS syntax first and inline styles as an afterthought?
- For quiz 2, remember to instruct students not to change the HTML

## Lab 4

- Switch out Palindrome question (too much copying)
- Maybe allow students to add inputs of their own (get confused by list of inputs)
- Loading spinner + debounce to know something happened
